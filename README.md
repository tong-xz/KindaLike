## Data preparation
After you download the two tar files from the Yelp website, copy them into the directory `./data`. Decompress all the files by
```shell
bash setup.sh
```
Tools provided by [yelp](https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples/tree/master) are placed in directory `./utils`. But not all functions could work for now.
